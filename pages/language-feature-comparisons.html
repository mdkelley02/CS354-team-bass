      <h2> What is Rust and how does it compare to other languages?</h2>
      <p>Well it is first important to note that Rust is a general purpose langauge, low level, and is best suited for
      systems, and other performance critical code.</p>
      <p>The largest and most noticeable difference between Rust and object oriented languages like C++ is the focus on
      safe code.</p>
      <p>In languages like C++ and C where pointer arithmatic and memory management are usually required, Rust is able
      to ignore those requirements and operate with safe and unsafe code.</p>
      <br><hr>
      <h2>Safe and Unsafe Code</h2>
      <p>In safe code, every given object has exact amount of memory needed and it is promised to be alloacted for that
      object.</p>
      <p>When a user trys to access an object, it is impossible to incorrectly access a memory location out of bounds.
      And when the process is done, the object is then automatically deallocated so the user does not have to manually
      free the object themselves.</p>
      <p>In unmanaged code, it is harder to write correct code but it also open up room for more bugs and errors to be
      present such as buffer overflows.</p>
      <p>While unmanaged/unsafe code is dangerous, it also can be incredibly fast in terms of operation performance.</p>
      <p>This is where Rust comes into play. Rust is able to let the user write unsafe code and set it to safe code.
      This makes the overall experience of the language much easier to learn because the avoidance of many errors that
      would be present in other languages. </p>
      <p>The main goal of Rust is to allow for efficient, fast, and memory safe systems. </p>
